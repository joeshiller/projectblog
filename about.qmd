Iâ€™m Joseph Shiller, a 4th-year Computer Science student at UCLA originally from Maryland. This project focuses on analyzing coup events across various countries using socioeconomic indicators to predict future coup attempts. My motivation for this project stems from an interest in politics and leveraging technology to make meaningful predictions. By identifying key factors that contribute to coups, I aim to help policymakers and analysts take proactive measures to enhance political stability and improve the quality of life in vulnerable regions.
