    "text": "This project aims to analyze coup events across various countries and then use socioeconomic indicators to predict a future coup attempt. The first dataset includes information about coups, including the date, type of event (coup, attempted, conspiracy), and various outcomes (e.g., realized, unrealized, injuries, deaths). The second dataset includes socioeconomic information about countries including GDP, HDI, Population, Birthrate, GDP(PPP), and etc.\n\nMotivation\nUnderstanding the patterns and causes of coup events can help in analyzing political stability and the factors contributing to future coup attempts. Being able to predict future attempts can help improve political stability.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhich countries have experienced the most coup events?\nHow do the types of coup events vary across different countries and time periods?\nWhich socioeconmic indicators can cause and predict future coup events?\nWhich model can best predict future coup attempts?\n\n\n\nBackground\nCoups are sudden and often violent takeovers of a government by a small group, usually involving the military. They have been common in many regions, especially in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia. Coups can drastically change the political situation in a country and often have negative effects on political stability, economic growth, freedom and safety\n\nNegative Impacts of Coups\n\nPolitical Instability:\n\nCoups create a period of uncertainty and instability. They disrupt normal political processes and can lead to power struggles. This instability can make people lose trust in their government.\n\nEconomic Decline:\n\nThe economy usually suffers after a coup. Investors lose confidence, leading to less investment and economic growth. Countries may face sanctions from other nations, making economic recovery even harder.\n\nSocial Unrest:\n\nCoups often lead to protests and violence. Governments may impose strict measures like curfews, which can increase tensions among the population.\n\nHuman Rights Violations:\n\nAfter a coup, human rights abuses often increase. Political opponents, activists, and journalists can be targeted, leading to arrests, torture, and sometimes killings. With democratic processes suspended, there are fewer checks on power, allowing abuses to continue.\n\n\n\n\nImportance of Predicting Future Coups\n\nPreventative Measures:\n\nPredicting future coups can help governments and international organizations take steps to prevent them. This might include diplomatic actions, economic aid, or support for democratic institutions to address instability.\n\nResource Allocation:\n\nPrediction models can help direct resources to areas most at risk of coups. Governments and NGOs can focus their efforts where they are most needed, ensuring better use of resources.\n\nStability and Development:\n\nPolitical stability is key for development. Predicting and preventing coups can help maintain a stable environment for economic growth and development. Stability allows for long-term planning and better policies for improving people’s lives.\n\nGlobal Security:\n\nInstability in one country can affect global security. Predicting coups can help prevent regional conflicts, mass migrations, and the spread of extremist ideologies. A stable world is safer and more prosperous for everyone.\n\n\nUnderstanding and predicting coups is important for maintaining political stability, economic growth, and safety in countries. Coups have severe negative impacts, including political instability, economic decline, social unrest, and human rights violations. By predicting future coups, policymakers and international organizations can take steps to prevent them, allocate resources efficiently, and promote stability and development. This proactive approach benefits both the countries at risk and contributes to global security and prosperity.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('/home/jovyan/DH140-Final-Project/Coup data.csv')\ndata['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data[['year', 'month', 'day']])\n\n\n\n# 2.
