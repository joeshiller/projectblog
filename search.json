    "text": "This project aims to analyze coup events across various countries and then use socioeconomic indicators to predict a future coup attempt. The first dataset includes information about coups, including the date, type of event (coup, attempted, conspiracy), and various outcomes (e.g., realized, unrealized, injuries, deaths). The second dataset includes socioeconomic information about countries including GDP, HDI, Population, Birthrate, GDP(PPP), and etc.\n\nMotivation\nUnderstanding the patterns and causes of coup events can help in analyzing political stability and the factors contributing to future coup attempts. Being able to predict future attempts can help improve political stability.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhich countries have experienced the most coup events?\nHow do the types of coup events vary across different countries and time periods?\nWhich socioeconmic indicators can cause and predict future coup events?\nWhich model can best predict future coup attempts?\n\n\n\n\n\n  Cell In[1], line 28\n    - Political stability is key for development. Predicting and preventing coups can help maintain a stable environment for economic growth and development. Stability allows for long-term planning and better policies for improving people's lives.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 28)"
