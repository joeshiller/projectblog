This can be valuable for understanding the underlying factors driving political instability.\n\nHandling Missing Values and Imbalanced Data:\n\nRandom Forest can handle missing values and is less affected by imbalanced data, which is common in datasets with rare events like coups. It uses techniques like class weighting to adjust for imbalance, improving predictive performance for minority classes.\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, roc_curve, auc\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\ncoup_data_path = '/home/jovyan/DH140-Final-Project/Coup data.csv'\ncountry_data_path = '/home/jovyan/DH140-Final-Project/Country_data.csv'\n\ncoup_data = pd.read_csv(coup_data_path)\ncountry_data = pd.read_csv(country_data_path)\n\ncoup_data_cleaned = coup_data.dropna()\ncountry_data_cleaned = country_data.dropna()\n\n\ncoup_summary = coup_data_cleaned.groupby('country')['event_type'].value_counts().unstack().fillna(0).reset_index()\n\nmerged_data = pd.merge(country_data_cleaned, coup_summary, how='left', left_on='Country', right_on='country').drop(columns=['country'])\n\n\nmerged_data_path = '/home/jovyan/DH140-Final-Project/Merged_Country_Coup_Data.csv'\nmerged_data.to_csv(merged_data_path, index=False)\n\ncoup_columns = ['attempted', 'conspiracy', 'coup']\nfor col in coup_columns:\n    merged_data[col] = merged_data[col].fillna(0)\n\nmerged_data['Coup attempts'] = merged_data[coup_columns].sum(axis=1)\n\nmerged_data = merged_data.drop(columns=coup_columns)\n\nupdated_merged_data_path = '/home/jovyan/DH140-Final-Project/Updated_Merged_Country_Coup_Data.csv'\nmerged_data.to_csv(updated_merged_data_path, index=False)\n\nnumeric_data = merged_data.drop(columns=['Country', 'UN Continental Region', 'UN Statistical Subregion']).fillna(0)\n\nX = numeric_data.drop(columns=['Coup attempts'])\ny = numeric_data['Coup attempts']\n\nmerged_data['Coup attempts binary'] = merged_data['Coup attempts'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x &gt; 0 else 0)\n\n\nnumeric_data = merged_data.drop(columns=['Country', 'UN Continental Region', 'UN Statistical Subregion']).fillna(0)\n\n\nX = numeric_data.drop(columns=['Coup attempts', 'Coup attempts binary'])\ny = numeric_data['Coup attempts binary']\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\n_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\n# Create and train the Random Forest Classifier\nrf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\nrf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n\ny_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nreport = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# Cross-validation\ncv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, random_state=42, shuffle=True)\ncv_accuracy = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy')\ncv_auc = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=cv, scoring='roc_auc')\n\n\ny_pred_proba = rf_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\n\n# Calculate ROC curve and AUC\nfpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_proba)\nroc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (area = {roc_auc:.2f})')\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')\nplt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])\nplt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])\nplt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\nplt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\nplt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')\nplt.legend(loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.show()\n\n# Get feature importance\nfeature_importances = pd.DataFrame(rf_model.feature_importances_, index=X.columns, columns=['importance']).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)\n\n# Plot the feature importance\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nsns.barplot(x=feature_importances['importance'], y=feature_importances.index)\nplt.title('Feature Importance for Predicting Future Coup Attempts (Binary)')\nplt.xlabel('Importance')\nplt.ylabel('Feature')\nplt.show()\n\n# Display the cross-validation accuracy and AUC\ncv_accuracy_mean = cv_accuracy.mean()\ncv_auc_mean = cv_auc.mean()\n\n\nprint(f'Average Cross-Validation Accuracy: {cv_accuracy.mean()}')\nprint(f'Average Cross-Validation AUC: {cv_auc.mean()}')\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Cross-Validation Accuracy: 0.791076923076923\nAverage Cross-Validation AUC: 0.7768790849673203\nAccuracy: 0.7948717948717948\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feature importance plot shows which features have the most influence on predicting future coup attempts. The top three features are:\n\nHDI (Human Development Index): This feature has the highest importance, suggesting that countries with different levels of human development have varying risks of coup attempts. This supports the belief that developing countries will have the highest chance of a coup attempt.\nPopulation 2022 & 2023: The population of a country in recent years is also a significant predictor, indicating that higher, denser populations may lead to more instability.\nIMF Forecast GDP (Nominal): Economic forecasts, particularly nominal GDP, are critical in determining the stability and risk of coups in a country. This shows that lower GDP, likely leads to more political instability.\n\nOther important features include %HDI Growth, Population %Change, UN Forecast GDP (Nominal), and various other economic and geographical indicators.\n\n\n\nThe ROC curve plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.73, indicating a reasonable ability of the model to distinguish between countries with and without coup attempts. A perfect model would have an AUC of 1.0, while a model with no discriminative ability would have an AUC of 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nCross-Validation Accuracy Scores: The accuracy scores from 5-fold cross-validation are consistently high, ranging from approximately 0.73 to 0.84, with an average accuracy of 0.791. This indicates that the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\nCross-Validation AUC Scores: The AUC scores from cross-validation range from approximately 0.64 to 0.87, with an average AUC of 0.777. This shows that the model has a good ability to distinguish between classes across different data folds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of 0.795 on the test set, which is consistent with the cross-validation accuracy. This suggests that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\nClassification Report: The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (0 and 1). The model performs better for class 1 (countries with coup attempts), with a precision and recall of 0.86. For class 0 (countries without coup attempts), the precision and recall are both 0.64. The overall weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are approximately 0.79.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model shows good performance in predicting future coup attempts, with HDI, population, and economic indicators being the most important features. The ROC curve and AUC indicate a reasonable discriminative ability, and cross-validation confirms the model’s robustness. The classification report highlights the model’s effectiveness, particularly for predicting countries with coup attempts.\nOverall, this analysis suggests that the Random Forest classifier is a suitable model for predicting future coup attempts based on the provided socioeconomic and demographic data. The model highlights that a country’s development is a key indicator of political stability."

    "text": "This project aimed to analyze coup events across various countries and use socioeconomic indicators to predict future coup attempts. The analysis revealed that Bolivia, Sudan, Argentina, Haiti, Venezuela, Syria, Thailand, Iraq, Guatemala, and Panama are the top 10 countries with the most coup events, with Bolivia experiencing the highest number. The types of coup events, including coups, attempts, and conspiracies, varied significantly across different countries and time periods, influenced by unique political, economic, and social factors.\nKey socioeconomic indicators identified as predictors of future coup attempts include the Human Development Index (HDI), population size in recent years, economic forecasts from institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and UN, as well as growth rates in HDI and population. The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization in predicting future coup attempts, achieving a higher accuracy of 0.79 and better cross-validation AUC scores of 0.78. The Random Forest model’s superior performance is attributed to its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions between features, handle class imbalance effectively, and provide robust predictions despite outliers and noise.\nThe Random Forest model results were impressive, with cross-validation accuracy scores ranging from 0.73 to 0.84 and cross-validation AUC scores ranging from 0.64 to 0.87. The average cross-validation accuracy was 0.791, and the average cross-validation AUC was 0.776. The test set accuracy was 0.795, demonstrating the model’s generalizability. The classification report further highlighted the model’s performance, with a precision, recall, and f1-score of 0.64 for class 0 (no coup attempts) and 0.86 for class 1 (coup attempts).\nImportantly, the Random Forest model identified the most significant features in predicting coup attempts. The Human Development Index (HDI), population size, and GDP were among the top predictors. These indicators highlight the critical role of socioeconomic factors in understanding and forecasting political instability. HDI reflects the overall development level of a country, while population size and GDP provide insights into demographic and economic conditions, respectively. These findings underscore the need to consider multiple dimensions of socioeconomic data when assessing the risk of coups."

    "text": "Conclusion\nUnderstanding the patterns and causes of coup events is crucial for analyzing political stability and identifying factors that contribute to future coup attempts. By leveraging models like Random Forest, policymakers and analysts can take proactive measures to enhance political stability and prevent future political instability. This project underscores the importance of using advanced predictive models and comprehensive socioeconomic data to anticipate and mitigate the risks that events like this can cause. The data clearly shows that developing, authoritarian, and conflict-ridden countries are more prone to frequent coups and political instability. This instability has far-reaching negative impacts on the economic, social, and human rights conditions of the affected populations. Understanding these patterns and predicting future coups is crucial for implementing measures to enhance political stability and improve the quality of life in these regions. Tracking HDI & GDP can help organizations provide aid to countries in need before their instability becomes out of control."

These regions tend to experience frequent coups, which contribute to severe political instability and have detrimental effects on their populations.\n\nTrends of Coup Events Over Time\nThe trend of coup events over time, categorized by event type (coup, attempted, conspiracy), shows that these incidents have been highly variable and unpredictable. Periods of intense coup activity are followed by relative calm, reflecting the instability inherent in these regions. This variability makes it challenging to anticipate future coups without advanced predictive models.\nThe top 10 countries with the most coup events are Bolivia, Sudan, Argentina, Haiti, Venezuela, Syria, Thailand, Iraq, Guatemala, and Panama. These countries share common characteristics:\n\nDeveloping Economies: Many of these countries are developing nations with fragile economies. Economic hardships and lack of opportunities can lead to dissatisfaction and unrest, providing fertile ground for coups.\nAuthoritarian Regimes: Authoritarian governments, often marked by lack of political freedoms and human rights abuses, face frequent coup attempts as different factions vie for power.\nConflict Zones: Countries like Syria and Iraq, which have experienced prolonged conflict and war, are more susceptible to coups due to the breakdown of traditional governance structures and the presence of armed groups.\n\n\n\nNegative Impacts on Populations\nCoups and political instability have severe negative impacts on the people living in these countries:\n\nEconomic Decline: Frequent coups disrupt economic activities, lead to capital flight, and deter foreign investment, resulting in economic decline and poverty.\nSocial Unrest: The instability following coups often leads to increased violence, protests, and social unrest, further destabilizing the country.\nHuman Rights Violations: Authoritarian regimes and coup leaders often resort to repression, leading to widespread human rights abuses, including arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe data clearly shows that developing, authoritarian, and conflict-ridden countries are more prone to frequent coups and political instability. This instability has far-reaching negative impacts on the economic, social, and human rights conditions of the affected populations. Understanding these patterns and predicting future coups is crucial for implementing measures to enhance political stability and improve the quality of life in these regions."
